# BetterReader

**BetterReader** is an open-source browser extension and website that serves as your AI copilot for reading, research, and learning across the web. Whether you're diving into technical papers, news articles, or blog posts, BetterReader helps you understand content more deeply through conversation, quizzes, and interactive tools.

BetterReader supports both online usage (via browser extension stores) and local usage by allowing users to configure their own LLM API keys.

> It is not yet available on browser extension stores. However, you can set up and run the extension locally using this repository. It currently supports Chrome-based browsers.
